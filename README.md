## Navigating Shinano

Shinano is currently in development and does not have all of the functionality the author intends for it to have.
The current functions are:

1. `Login` using the demo user or another account.

2. `Signup` using any valid data to create an account.

3. Create a `product` that you would like to have on Shinano.

4. Navigate to `products`.

5. Edit any `product` that you have created.

6. Delete any `product` that you have created. This also removes the `product` from other users carts.

7. Create a `cart` to start shopping. This is either done manually by the user, or automatically when shopping begins.
Only a logged in user may create a `cart` and shop.

8. Look at the items in your `cart`.

9. Edit the items in your `cart`.

10. Delete your entire `cart`. This actually deletes your cart, not just removing your items from an existing cart.
